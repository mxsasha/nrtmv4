1.  Introduction

   The Internet Routing Registry (IRR) consists of several IRR
   Databases, each storing objects in the Routing Policy Specification
   Language (RPSL).  About a dozen larger IRR Databases are well known
   and widely used, operated by different organisations, like RIRs and
   some large network operators.  IRR objects serve many purposes,
   ranging from manual research by operators to automated network
   configuration and filtering.

   Most of these well known IRR Databases mirror IRR objects from some
   others, so that queries run against these instances provide a
   comprehensive view.  Some parties also mirror IRR Databases to
   private IRR server instances, to reduce latency in queries, analyze
   IRR objects, or other purposes.

   NRTM version 4 is a protocol for IRR mirroring, designed to address
   issues in existing IRR Database mirroring protocols.  In NRTMv4, IRR
   Databases publish their records on an HTTPS endpoint, with periodic
   Snapshot Files and regular Delta Files.  Signing allows integrity
   checks.  By only generating files once and publishing them over
   HTTPS, scalability is dramatically improved.  It borrows some
   concepts in [RFC8182], as there are overlaps between the two
   protocols.

2.  Informal overview

   In NRTMv4, a mirror server is an instance of IRR Database software
   that has a database of IRR objects and publishes them to allow
   mirroring by others.  This can be retrieved by mirror clients, which
   then load the IRR objects into their local storage.

   Publication consists of three different files:

Internet-Draft                   NRTM v4                   November 2022


   *  A single Update Notification File.  This specifies the current
      Database version and locations of the Snapshot File and Delta
      Files.  Additionally, there is an Update Notification Signature
      File, used to verify the authenticity of the Update Notification
      File.

   *  A single active Snapshot File.  This contains all published IRR
      objects at a particular version.  The mirror server periodically
      generates a new snapshot.

   *  Zero or more Delta Files.  These contain the changes between two
      database version numbers.

   All files MUST be in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format
   [RFC4627].

   Mirror clients initially retrieve the small Update Notification File
   and a Snapshot File, from which they initialize their local copy of
   the Database.  After that, mirror clients only retrieve the Update
   Notification File periodically to determine whether there are any
   changes, and then retrieve only the relevant Delta Files, if any.
   This minimizes data transfer.  Deltas have sequential versions.

   Mirror clients are configured with the URL of an Update Notification
   File, name of the IRR Database, and a public signing key.  This
   public key is used to verify the Update Notification File, which in
   turn contains hashes of all the Snapshot and Delta Files.

   Upon initialization, the mirror server generates a session ID for the
   Database.  This allows long term caching and used by the client to
   determine that the Delta Files continue to form a full set of changes
   allowing an update to the latest version.  If the mirror server loses
   partial history, or the mirror client starts mirroring from a
   different server, the session ID change will force a full reload from
   the latest Snapshot File, ensuring there are no accidental mirroring
   gaps.

   Mirror servers can use caching to reduce their load, particularly
   because snapshots and deltas are immutable for a given session ID and
   version number.  These are also the largest files.  Update
   Notification Files may not be cached for longer than one minute, but
   are fairly small.

   Note that in NRTMv4, a contiguous version number is used for the
   Database version and Delta Files.  This is different and unrelated to
   the serial in NRTMv3.  NRTMv3 serials refer to a single change to a
   single object, whereas a NRTMv4 version refers to one delta, possibly
   containing multiple changes to multiple objects.  NRTMv3 serials can
   also contain gaps, NRTMv4 versions may not.

3.  Mirror server use

3.1.  Key Configuration

   When enabling NRTMv4 publication for an IRR Database, the operator
   MUST generate and configure a private Ed25519 [RFC8032] key.  The
   operator then provides this public key, the name of the IRR Database,
   and publication URL of the Update Notification File to any operators
   of mirror clients.  The process for providing this is not in scope of
   this protocol, but a typical case is publication on the operator's
   known website.  Key rotation is described in Section 8.4.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementations provide easily accessible
   tools for operators to generate new Ed25519 keys to enter into their
   configuration and assist with key rotation.  All configuration
   options SHOULD be clearly named to indicate that they are private
   keys.

3.2.  Snapshot Initialization

   A mirror server MUST follow the initialization steps upon the first
   export for an IRR Database by that mirror server, or if the server
   lost history and can not reliably produce a continuous set of deltas
   from a previous state.

   In other words, either the mirror server guarantees that clients
   following the deltas have a correct and complete view, or MUST
   reinitialize, which will force clients to reinitialize as well.

   Initialization consists of these actions:

   *  The mirror server MUST generate a new session ID.  This MUST be a
      random v4 UUID [RFC4122] and MUST be the same across all client
      sessions.  However, if the server instance is serving two
      different IRR databases (e.g.  RIPE IRR and RIPE-NONAUTH IRR),
      then it MUST generate two session IDs, each one associated with
      the different database.

   *  The server MUST generate a snapshot for version number one.  This
      may contain an empty array of objects if the IRR Database is
      currently empty.

Internet-Draft                   NRTM v4                   November 2022


   *  The server MUST generate a new Update Notification File with the
      new session ID, a reference to the new snapshot, and no deltas.

   *  The Update Notification Signature File MUST be updated for the new
      Update Notification File contents.

   Note that session IDs, versions and all files always relate to a
   specific IRR Database.  For example, a mirror server publishing
   NRTMv4 for RIPE and RIPE-NONAUTH, will generate two Update
   Notification Files, referring two Snapshot Files, and two sets of
   Delta Files each with contiguous version numbers - all completely
   independent to each other, with different session IDs.  This applies
   even if the same IRR server instance produces both.

3.3.  Publishing updates

3.3.1.  Delta Files

   Changes to IRR objects MUST be recorded in Delta Files.  One Delta
   File can contain multiple changes.

   Updates are generated as follows:

   *  A mirror server MUST publish a Delta File approximately every
      minute, if there have been changes to IRR objects in that time
      frame.

   *  If multiple changes have occurred within the time frame that would
      cancel each other out, like an addition and immediate deletion of
      the same object, the mirror server MUST still include all these
      changes.

   *  If a mirror server is lagging in production of Delta Files, such
      as after an initialization or server downtime, it MUST generate
      one larger "catch up" Delta File, rather than individual Delta
      Files for every one minute window.

   *  A new Delta File MUST be generated with a new version, one greater
      than the last Delta File version, or one greater than the last
      Snapshot File version if there were no prior deltas at all.

   *  The Delta File MUST include all changes that happened during the
      time frame, in the order in which they occurred.

   *  The URL where the Delta File is published MUST contain the session
      ID and version number to allow it to be indefinitely cached.  It
      MUST also contain a random value that can not be predicted before
      publication, to counter negative caching issues.

Internet-Draft                   NRTM v4                   November 2022


   *  After generating a new Delta File, a mirror server MUST remove all
      Delta Files older than 24 hours.

   *  The Update Notification File MUST be updated to include the new
      Delta File and update the database version.

   *  Note that, as Delta Files always contain changes compared to a
      previous state, there can never be a Delta File with version 1.

3.3.2.  Snapshot Files

   Snapshot Files after initialization are generated as follows:

   *  The mirror server MUST generate a new Snapshot File between once
      per hour and once per day, if there have been changes to the IRR
      objects.

   *  The version number of the new snapshot MUST be equal to the last
      Delta File version.

   *  If there have been no changes to the IRR objects since the last
      snapshot, the mirror server MUST NOT generate a new snapshot.

   *  The URL where the Snapshot File is published MUST contain the
      session ID and version number to allow it to be indefinitely
      cached.  It MUST also contain a random value that can not be
      predicted before publication, to counter negative caching issues.

   *  The Update Notification File MUST be updated to include the new
      snapshot, if one was generated.

3.3.3.  Update Notification File

   The Update Notification File must be updated when a new Delta or
   Snapshot File is published and, even if there have been no changes,
   at least every 24 hours.

   After any update to the Update Notification file, the mirror server
   MUST also update the Update Notification Signature File for the new
   Update Notification File contents.

Internet-Draft                   NRTM v4                   November 2022


3.3.4.  Publication Policy Restrictions

   A mirror server MAY have a policy that restricts the publication of
   certain IRR objects or attributes, or modifies these before
   publication.  Typical scenarios for this include preventing the
   distribution of certain personal data or password hashes, or
   excluding objects which do not meet validation rules like RPKI
   consistency.  It is RECOMMENDED to modify objects in such a way that
   this change is evident to humans reading the object text, for example
   by adding remark lines or comments.

   Mirror servers are RECOMMENDED to remove password hashes from the
   auth lines in mntner objects, as they have little use beyond the
   authoritative server, and their publication may be a security risk.

   If a mirror server has a policy that restricts or modifies object
   publication, this MUST be applied consistently to Snapshot Files and
   Delta Files from the moment the policy is enacted or modified.

4.  Mirror client use

4.1.  Client Configuration

   Mirror clients are configured with the name of the IRR Database, the
   URL of the Update Notification File, and the public key currently
   used for signing the Update Notification File.  Key rotation is
   described in Section 8.4.

4.2.  Initialization from snapshot

   Clients MUST initialize from a Snapshot File when initially
   configured or if they are not able to update their local data from
   the provided Delta Files:

   *  The client MUST retrieve the Update Notification File.

   *  The client MUST verify that the source attribute in the Update
      Notification File matches the configured IRR Database name.

   *  The client MUST retrieve the Snapshot File and load the objects
      into its local storage.

   *  The mirror client MUST verify that the hash of the Snapshot File
      matches the hash in the Update Notification File that referenced
      it.  In case of a mismatch of this hash, the file MUST be
      rejected.

Internet-Draft                   NRTM v4                   November 2022


   *  The client MUST record the configured authoritative domain, the
      session_id and version from the Update Notification File.

4.3.  Processing Delta Files

   If a mirror client has previously initialized from a snapshot:

   *  The client MUST verify that the configured Update Notification
      File URL matches the previously known URL.  If this does not
      match, the client MUST reinitialize from the Snapshot File, using
      the new Update Notification File URL.

   *  The client MUST retrieve the Update Notification File.

   *  The client MUST verify that the session ID matches the previously
      known session ID.  If this does not match, the client MUST
      reinitialize from the snapshot.

   *  The client MUST verify that the Update Notification File version
      is the same or higher than the client's current most recent
      version, to the latest version in the Update Notification File.
      If not, the Update Notification File MUST be rejected.

   *  The client MUST verify that the Update Notification File contains
      one contiguous set of Delta File versions from the client's
      current most recent version up to the latest version in the Update
      Notification File.  If this is not found, the client MUST
      reinitialize from the snapshot.

   *  The client MUST retrieve all Delta Files for versions since the
      client's last known version, if there are any.

   *  The mirror client MUST verify that the hash of each newly
      downloaded Delta File matches the hash in the Update Notification
      File that referenced it.  In case of a mismatch of this hash, the
      Delta File MUST be rejected.

   *  The client MUST process all changes in the Delta Files in order:
      lowest Delta File version number first, and in the order of the
      changes list in the Delta File.

   *  The client MUST update its record of the most recent version to
      the version of the Update Notification File.

   If the Update Notification File or one of the Delta Files is
   rejected, the mirror client MUST NOT process any newer Deltas than
   those that are valid and have been successfully verified.

Internet-Draft                   NRTM v4                   November 2022


4.4.  Signature and Staleness Verification

   Every time a mirror client retrieves a new version of the Update
   Notification File, it MUST retrieve and verify the Update
   Notification Signature File.  The signature MUST be valid for the
   configured public key for the contents of the Update Notification
   File.  If the signature does not match, the mirror client MUST reject
   the Update Notification File, unless a key rotation is in progress as
   described in Section 8.4.

   A mirror client can use the generation timestamp in the Update
   Notification File to check whether the file is stale, as the mirror
   server must update this file at least every 24 hours.  If the
   generation timestamp is more than 24 hours ago, the file is stale and
   the mirror client SHOULD warn the operator in log messages or other
   alerting, but MAY continue to process it otherwise.

4.5.  Policy Restrictions

   A mirror client MAY have a policy that restricts the processing of
   objects to certain object classes, or other limitations on which
   objects it processes.

   If a mirror client has a policy that restricts object processing,
   this MUST be applied consistently to Snapshot Files and Delta Files
   from the moment the policy is enacted or modified.

5.  Update Notification File

5.1.  Purpose

   The Update Notification File is generated by the mirror server and
   used by mirror clients to discover whether any changes exist between
   the state of the IRR mirror server and of the mirror client's.  It
   also describes the location of the Snapshot File and incremental
   Delta Files.  Finally, the generation timestamp can be used to detect
   whether the file is stale.

   The mirror server MUST generate a new Update Notification File every
   time there are new deltas or snapshots and, even if there have been
   no changes, at least every 24 hours.

5.2.  Cache concerns

   A mirror server may use caching infrastructure to cache the Update
   Notification File and reduce the load of HTTPS requests.





Romijn, et al.             Expires 11 May 2023                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                   NRTM v4                   November 2022


   However, since this file is used by mirror clients to determine
   whether any updates are available, the mirror server SHOULD ensure
   that this file is not cached for longer than one minute.  An
   exception to this rule is that it is better to serve a stale Update
   Notification File rather than no Update Notification File.

5.3.  File format and validation

   Example Update Notification File:

{
  "nrtm_version": 4,

Internet-Draft                   NRTM v4                   November 2022


   *  The nrtm_version MUST be 4.

   *  The timestamp MUST be an [RFC3339] timestamp.

   *  The type MUST be "notification".

   *  The optional field next_signing_key is used for in-band key
      rotation.  If present, it MUST be an Ed25519 [RFC8032] public key
      encoded in base64 [RFC4648], which matches the private key the
      mirror server will start using to sign the Update Notification
      File in the near future.  Key rotation is described in
      Section 8.4.

   *  The source MUST be a valid IRR object name [RFC2622].

   *  The session_id attribute MUST be a random v4 UUID [RFC4122] unique
      to this session for this source.

   *  The version MUST be an unsigned positive integer and be equal to
      the highest version of the deltas and snapshot.

   *  The file MUST contain exactly one snapshot.

   *  The file MAY contain one or more deltas.

   *  The deltas MUST have a sequential contiguous set of version
      numbers.

   *  Each snapshot and delta element MUST have a version, HTTPS URL and
      hash attribute.

   *  The hash attribute in snapshot and delta elements MUST be the
      hexadecimal encoding of the SHA-256 hash [SHS] of the referenced
      file.  The mirror client MUST verify this hash when the file is
      retrieved and reject the file if the hash does not match.

   *  The file MUST only contain US-ASCII characters.

5.4.  Signature

   The contents of Update Notification File MUST be signed using Ed25519
   [RFC8032].  The public key for this signature is configured in the
   client.  The signature of the Update Notification File MUST be
   published under the same path as the Update Notification File,
   appending ".sig".

6.  Snapshot File

Internet-Draft                   NRTM v4                   November 2022


6.1.  Purpose

   The Snapshot File reflects the complete and current contents of all
   IRR objects in an IRR Database.  Mirror clients MUST use this to
   initialize their local copy of the IRR Database.

6.2.  Cache Concerns

   A snapshot reflects the content of the IRR Database at a specific
   point in time; for that reason, it can be considered immutable data.
   Snapshot Files MUST be published at a URL that is unique to the
   specific session and version.  The URL MUST also contain a random
   value that can not be predicted before publication, to counter
   negative caching issues.

   Because these files never change, they MAY be cached indefinitely.
   However, as snapshots are large and old snapshots will no longer be
   referred by newer Update Notification Files, it is RECOMMENDED that a
   limited interval is used in the order of hours or days.

   To avoid race conditions where a mirror client retrieves an Update
   Notification File moments before it's updated, mirror servers SHOULD
   retain old Snapshot Files for at least 5 minutes after a new Update
   Notification File is published.

6.3.  File format and validation

   Example Snapshot File:

   {
     "nrtm_version": 4,
     "type": "snapshot",
     "source": "EXAMPLE",
     "session_id": "ca128382-78d9-41d1-8927-1ecef15275be",
     "version": 3,
     "objects": [
       "route: 192.0.2.0/24\norigin: AS65530\nsource: EXAMPLE",
       "route: 2001:db8::/32\norigin: AS65530\nsource: EXAMPLE"
     ]
   }

   Note: IRR object texts in this example are shortened because of
   formatting.

   The following validation rules MUST be observed when creating or
   parsing Snapshot Files:

   *  The nrtm_version MUST be 4.

Internet-Draft                   NRTM v4                   November 2022


   *  The type MUST be "snapshot".

   *  The source MUST match the source in the Update Notification File.

   *  The session_id attribute MUST match the session_id in the Update
      Notification File.

   *  The version MUST be an unsigned positive integer, matching the
      Update Notification File entry for this snapshot.

   *  The objects attribute MUST be an array of zero or more elements,
      each containing a string representation of an IRR object.  In the
      string representation all characters that are not ASCII graphic
      characters ([RFC0020] section 4.5) must be escaped as described in
      [RFC4627] section 2.5.

   *  The source attribute in the IRR object texts MUST match the source
      attribute of the Snapshot File.

   *  The file MUST only contain ASCII graphic characters ([RFC0020]
      section 4.5).

7.  Delta File

7.1.  Purpose

   A Delta File contains all changes for exactly one incremental update
   of the IRR Database.  It may include new, modified and deleted
   objects.  Delta Files can contain multiple alterations to multiple
   objects.

7.2.  Cache Concerns

   Deltas reflect the difference in content of the IRR Database from one
   version to another; for that reason, it can be considered immutable
   data.  Delta Files MUST be published at a URL that is unique to the
   specific session and version.  The URL MUST also contain a random
   value that can not be predicted before publication, to counter
   negative caching issues.

   To avoid race conditions where a mirror client retrieves an Update
   Notification File moments before it's updated, mirror servers SHOULD
   retain old Delta Files for at least 5 minutes after a new Update
   Notification File is published that no longer contains these Delta
   Files.

7.3.  File format and validation

   Example Delta File:

{
  "nrtm_version": 4,
  "type": "delta",
  "source": "EXAMPLE",
  "session_id": "ca128382-78d9-41d1-8927-1ecef15275be",
  "version": 3,
  "changes": [
    {
      "action": "delete",
      "object_class": "person",
      "primary_key": "PRSN1-EXAMPLE"
    },
    {
      "action": "delete",
      "object_class": "route",
      "primary_key": "192.0.2.0/24AS65530"
    },
    {
      "action": "add_modify",
      "object": "route: 2001:db8::/32\norigin: AS65530\nsource: EXAMPLE"
    }
  ]
}

   Note: IRR object texts in this example are shortened because of
   formatting.

   The following validation rules MUST be observed when creating or
   parsing Delta Files:

   *  The nrtm_version MUST be 4.

   *  The type MUST be "delta".

   *  The source MUST match the source in the Update Notification File.

   *  The session_id attribute MUST match the session_id in the Update
      Notification File.

   *  The version MUST be an unsigned positive integer, matching the
      Update Notification File entry for this delta.

   *  The changes attribute MUST be an array of one or more elements,
      each having:

      -  An action attribute, which is either "delete" for object
         deletions, or "add_modify" for additions or modifications.

      -  If action is "delete": an object_class attribute with the RPSL
         object class name, and a primary_key attribute with the primary
         key, of the deleted object.  For objects that are listed in
         [RFC2622] and [RFC4012] the primary key is the value of the
         RPSL field defined as "class key".  For object classes that
         define a pair of attributes as class key, e.g. route, the
         values of the individual attributes are appended together
         without separators.  For any other objects, the primary key is
         the value of the RPSL field with the same name as the object
         class name.

      -  If action is "add_modify": an object attribute with the RPSL
         text of the new version of the object.

      -  In the string representation all characters that are not ASCII
         graphic characters ([RFC0020] section 4.5) must be escaped as
         described in [RFC4627] section 2.5.

   *  The source attribute in the IRR object texts MUST match the source
      attribute of the Delta File.

   *  The file MUST only contain ASCII graphic characters ([RFC0020]
      section 4.5).

8.  Operational Considerations

8.1.  IRR object Validation

   Throughout the years, various implementations of IRR servers have
   taken liberties with the various RFCs regarding RPSL.
   Implementations have introduced different new object classes,
   attributes and validation rules.  Current IRR Databases also contain
   legacy objects which were created under different validation rules.
   In practice, there is no uniformly implemented standard for RPSL, but
   merely rough outlines partially documented in different places.

   This has the potential to create interoperability issues.  Some are
   addressed by NRTMv4, like having a consistent character set when
   mirroring data between implementations.  However, some issues can not
   be addressed in this way, such as one implementation introducing a
   new object class that is entirely unknown to another implementation.







Romijn, et al.             Expires 11 May 2023                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                   NRTM v4                   November 2022


   A mirror client SHOULD be able to handle unknown object classes and
   objects that are invalid according to its own validation rules, which
   may mean simply discarding them, without rejecting remaining objects
   or preventing future updates.

   It is RECOMMENDED for mirror clients to log these cases, particularly
   those where an object was discarded due to violating validation
   rules.  These cases create an inconsistency between the IRR objects
   of the server and client, and logs facilitate later analysis.

   It is RECOMMENDED for mirror clients to be flexible where possible
   and reasonable when applying their own validation rules to IRR
   objects retrieved from mirror servers.  For example, a route object
   with an origin attribute that is not a valid AS number can't be
   usefully interpreted.  There is no way for an IRR server to correctly
   parse and index such an object.  However, a route-set object whose
   name does not start with "RS-" [RFC2622], or an inetnum with an
   unknown extra "org" attribute, still allows the mirror client to
   interpret it unambiguously even if it does not meet the mirror
   client's own validation rules for authoritative records.

8.2.  Intermediate mirror instances

   An IRR Database generally has a single authoritative source.  In some
   cases, an instance run by a third party will function as a kind of
   intermediate: both being a mirror client, mirroring IRR objects from
   the authoritative source, and simultaneously function as a mirror
   server to yet another mirror client.

   There are various operational reasons for such a setup, such as the
   intermediate filtering certain records.  Regardless of the reason,
   the mirror client and server function of an IRR server must be
   treated as separate processes.  In particular, this means they MUST
   have separate session IDs.  The intermediate server MUST NOT
   republish the same files it retrieved from the authoritative source
   with the same session ID.

8.3.  Reading from local files

   In the typical use case for NRTMv4, a mirror client retrieves files
   from an HTTPS endpoint.  However, implementations MAY also support
   reading from files on the local filesystem instead, for when
   operators want to use a different method to retrieve or distribute
   the files.  When reading from local files, mirror clients SHOULD
   still follow all validation rules, including the validation of the
   signature and hashes.

Internet-Draft                   NRTM v4                   November 2022


8.4.  Public key rotation

   It is RECOMMENDED that IRR Database operators rotate the signing key
   on their mirror server about once per year.  The next_signing_key
   field in the Update Notification File supports in-band key rotation
   using the following process:

   *  The server operator generates a new key and configures this in the
      mirror server implementation as the upcoming new signing key.

   *  The mirror server MUST include this key in the next_signing_key
      field in any Update Notification File generated while the new
      signing key is configured.  Hence, the new signing key will start
      being propagated to the mirror clients with the next publication
      of the Notification File, which will take at most 24 hours.
      Mirror server implementations MAY offer a method to cause the
      Notification Update File to be refreshed earlier, with the
      new_signing_key included, and thus start the propagation earlier.

   *  When mirror clients next retrieve the Update Notification File,
      they MUST detect the next_signing_key field, and store the key in
      their configuration.

   *  After allowing mirror clients time to have seen the new Update
      Notification File with the next_signing_key field, the mirror
      server operator configures the new key as currently active key,
      and removes the old key.  Any Update Notification File generated
      after this point MUST be signed with this new key, and will not
      contain a next_signing_key field.

   *  The RECOMMENDED period between publication of the upcoming key in
      the next_signing_key field, and removal of the old key, is one
      week.  This offers all active clients a reasonable chance to
      follow the rotation process.

   *  When mirror clients retrieve an Update Notification File and find
      that the signature does not match, they MUST attempt to verify
      against a next_signing_key encountered in a previous (valid) file.
      If the signature matches for this new key, the client MUST update
      its configuration to use the new key for validation.

   If a mirror client never retrieves an Update Notification file at any
   point during the rotation process, it will no longer be able to
   verify the signature.  In that scenario manual recovery is required,
   similar to a first time configuration of a new mirror client.

9.  Security Considerations

   IRR objects serve many purposes, including automated network
   configuration and filtering.  Manipulation of IRR objects can
   therefore have a significant security impact.  However, security in
   existing protocols is mostly absent.

   Before NRTMv4, the most common protocols for IRR Database mirroring
   are FTP for retrieving full snapshots, and NRTM version 3 for
   retrieving later changes.  There are no provisions for integrity or
   authenticity, and there are various scenarios where mirroring may not
   be reliable.

   NRTMv4 requires integrity verification.  The Delta and Snapshot Files
   are verified using the SHA-256 hash in the Update Notification File,
   and the Update Notification File is verified using its signature
   file.  Additionally, the channel security offered by HTTPS further
   limits security risks.

   By allowing publication on any HTTPS endpoint, NRTMv4 allows for
   extensive scaling, and there are many existing techniques and
   services to protect against denial-of-service attacks.  In contrast,
   NRTMv3 required mirror clients to directly query the IRR server
   instance with special whois queries.  This scales poorly, and there
   are no standard protections against denial-of-service available.

   The HTTPS endpoint used for NRTMv4 MUST be configured according to
   the best practices in [RFC7525].
